= Enum REST API

REST-API for managing configurable enumerations in the pet clinic application.
It provides operations to create, update, and retrieve enumeration values organized by discriminator.
Each enumeration type is identified by a discriminator and contains ordered items with unique numeric codes, names, and display texts.

TIP: This API uses a custom controller, not the standard endpoints provided by Spring Data REST.

NOTE: Verify that the EnumRestController properly validates unique constraints for both code and name within each discriminator group. Check the @UniqueConstraint annotations in the Enum entity match the controller behavior. 

== Model

=== Enum

The main entity of an _Enum_ managed by this controller for persistence.
The entity extends `JsonJpaEntity` which provides unique identifier and version for optimistic locking.
Each enum represents an extensible enumeration item.
Enums are organized by discriminator for logical grouping (e.g., "SPECIES", "SKILL").
Within each discriminator group, codes and names must be unique.
Codes are numeric.
