= Vet REST API

REST-API for managing veterinarians in the pet clinic application.
It provides standard CRUD operations and a search endpoint that returns items.

== Model

=== Vet

The main entity of a _Vet_ managed by this controller for persistence.
The entity extends `JsonJpaEntity` which provides unique identifier and version for optimistic locking.
Each vet represents a pet clinic veterinarian.
The vet requires a valid name and has a set of skills.

NOTE: The allSkill field is an @ElementCollection (not a relation like @ManyToOne), which is treated as a collection of simple values. Template rules state: "Describe operations for attributes with only the first example." Since allSkill behaves like an attribute (collection stored in a separate table but not an entity relation), and snippet patch-api-vet-skill exists, clarify whether @ElementCollection should be treated as an attribute (showing only name example) or documented separately. Based on standard interpretation, @ElementCollection is not a relation, so current documentation showing only the name example is correct per template.

This operation reports `Ok` or code 200 if the object was successfully updated.

This operation reports `Not Found` or code 404 if the entity does not exist.

`?allSkill=surgery`::
