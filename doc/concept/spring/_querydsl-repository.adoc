= QuerydslRepository

The `QuerydslRepository` interface extends Spring Data's QueryDSL support with custom binding methods for common query patterns.
It provides utility methods for handling date ranges, numeric ranges and flexible string matching predicates.

== Properties

None

== Operations

=== localDateEqBetweenInBinding

The method provides flexible `LocalDate` querying:

**Single value**::
Uses exact match with `eq()`.
**Two values**::
Creates date range query with `between()`.
**Multiple values**::
Uses exact matches with `in()`.

=== longEqBetweenInBinding

The method provides flexible Long value querying:

**Single value**::
Uses exact match with `eq()`.
**Two values**::
Creates numeric range query with `between()`.
**Multiple values**::
Uses exact matches with `in()`.

=== stringContainsOrLikeIgnoreCaseBinding

The method provides intelligent string matching:

**Contains '%' character**::
Uses SQL LIKE pattern matching with `likeIgnoreCase()`.
**No '%' character**::
Uses case-insensitive substring search with `containsIgnoreCase()`.

== Tests

The test approach relies on the concept of component integration with `@SpringBootTest` and verifies database operations with an embedded database.
Liquibase applies all changelog scripts so tables, constraints, indexes, etc. exist.

Tests are isolated using `@Transactional` and `@Rollback(true)`.
Each test builds its own state.
Changes must not persist between tests.
