= QuerydslRepository

The `QuerydslRepository` interface extends Spring Data's QueryDSL support with custom binding methods for common query patterns.
It provides utility methods for handling date ranges, numeric ranges and flexible string matching predicates.

For each entity QueryDSL generates a Q-classes that are type-safe representation of entity classes and their properties.
Q-classes transform database queries from error-prone strings to strongly-typed and compile-time checked operations.

TIP: See the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/data-commons/repositories/core-extensions.html[Spring Data Extensions reference guide]
for more information about the QueryDSL extension.

== Properties

None

== Operations

=== localDateEqBetweenInBinding

The method provides flexible `LocalDate` querying:

**Single value**::
Uses exact match with `eq()`.
**Two values**::
Creates date range query with `between()`.
**Multiple values**::
Uses exact matches with `in()`.

=== longEqBetweenInBinding

The method provides flexible Long value querying:

**Single value**::
Uses exact match with `eq()`.
**Two values**::
Creates numeric range query with `between()`.
**Multiple values**::
Uses exact matches with `in()`.

=== stringContainsOrLikeIgnoreCaseBinding

The method provides intelligent string matching:

**Contains '%' character**::
Uses SQL LIKE pattern matching with `likeIgnoreCase()`.
**No '%' character**::
Uses case-insensitive substring search with `containsIgnoreCase()`.

== Tests

The test approach relies on the concept of component integration with `@SpringBootTest` and verifies database operations with an embedded database.
Liquibase applies all changelog scripts so tables, constraints, indexes, etc. exist.

Tests are isolated using `@Transactional` and `@Rollback(true)`.
Each test builds its own state.
Changes must not persist between tests.
