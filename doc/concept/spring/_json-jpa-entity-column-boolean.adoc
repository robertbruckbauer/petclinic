= Column for type `boolean`

== Default Implementation

.Entity
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@Column(name = "flag") <1>
@Getter <2>
@JsonProperty <3>
private boolean flag; <4>
----

<1> The field is marked with `@Column`.
The column name in the database is explicitly specified.
<2> The field is marked with `@Getter`.
This allows the current value to be queried via a getter method.
<3> The field is marked with `@JsonProperty`.
The value is included in the JSON structure of the REST API.
<4> The field has the primitive data type `boolean`.
Using the primitive type avoids null issues.
This is a mutable field due to requirements from the JPA provider.

.Liquibase
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<column name="flag" type="BOOLEAN" defaultValueBoolean="false"> <1>
    <constraints nullable="false"/> <2>
</column>
----

<1> The column type is `BOOLEAN` with a default value of `false`.
<2> The column is marked as NOT NULL.

== Property initialization

`boolean` properties are not nullable and initialized in the constructor.

== Property manipulation

`boolean` properties are typically only changed through REST endpoints.

`boolean` properties are copied in the `withId` operation during entity cloning.

Add a setter if a controller must be able to update a property directly.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@JsonIgnore <1>
public Entity setFlag(final boolean flag) { <2>
    this.flag = flag;
    return this; <3>
}
----

<1> The method is marked with `@JsonIgnore` as it is not part of the JSON API.
<2> The method accepts a primitive `boolean` argument.
<3> The method returns `this` for operation chaining.

== Property verification

`boolean` properties participate in the `isEqual` method comparison.
Use `==` for direct comparison.

The `verify` operation may include custom validation logic.

== Property serialization

`boolean` properties are by default part of the JSON structure.
