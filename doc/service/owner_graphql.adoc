= Owner GraphQL API

GraphQL API for querying pet owners in the pet clinic application.
It provides query operations to retrieve all owners, find owners by identifier or name, and navigate the owner-pet relationship.

== Schema

=== Owner

The main GraphQL type representing a pet owner who acts as a client in the pet clinic.

.Schema
[source,graphql,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{graphqldir}/owner.gqls[]
----

The `Owner` type corresponds to the entity class defined in the backend API:

.Entity
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{includedir}/lib/backend-api/src/main/java/esy/api/client/Owner.java[indent=0,tags=properties]
----

Each owner represents a pet clinic client who can own multiple pets.
The owner requires a valid name,, address and contact information.
The `name` attribute is required and unique.

The `allPet` field uses batch loading via `@BatchMapping` to efficiently load pets for multiple owners.
