= Pet REST API

REST-API for managing pets in the pet clinic application.
It provides standard CRUD operations and a search endpoint that returns items.

== Model

=== Pet

Each pet represents an animal owned by a client in the pet clinic.
The `name` attribute is required and unique per owner, allowing different owners to have pets with the same name.
The `born` attribute is required.
The `species` attribute is required.
The `owner` relation is required because every pet must belong to an owner.

The liquibase script defines the database table.

The entity class extends `JsonJpaEntity` which provides unique identifier and version for optimistic locking.
