= Name of the GraphQL API

In this preamble write a brief summary of the model and queries of this controller.
Take into account the names of types, fields, and query operations from the GraphQL schema definition and names, properties and methods from entity classes, repository interfaces, controller classes and unit tests.

== Schema

In this chapter describe the schema of the API.
Take in account the names, properties and methods from entity classes used in the repository interfaces and controller classes.

In this chapter describe the model of the API.
Take in account the names, properties and methods from entity classes used in the repository interfaces and controller classes.

Add the schema definition from `resources/graphql` with a source block and title `Schema`.
Use the include directive to include the file.
Use variable `{graphqldir}` for root path.

Add the java class for the main entity class with a source block and title `Entity`.
Use the include directive and tags to select only relevant properties from the code with their types and annotations.
Use variable `{includedir}` for root path.

Let included schema definitions be a major part of the documentation.
Do not repeat information from the schema in the text.

Briefly describe the purpose of each type and its relationship to the domain model.
Reference the corresponding entity classes where applicable.

If the schema definition includes relationships that use batch loading (via @BatchMapping),
document the optimization strategy to avoid n+1 query problems.
Explain how related entities are efficiently loaded in a single database query.
Do not explain the n+1 query problem, just mention it.

If the schema uses custom scalar types, document each type and its mapping to a Java type individually.
Do not mention built-in scalar types.

== Queries

In this chapter describe the query operations of the API.
There is a separate section for each query operation.
The title consists of the query name.
Briefly describe the purpose of the query, its arguments and return value.

Create sections in the following order:

Collection queries::
Queries that return lists of objects.
Describe the purpose and any filtering arguments.

Object queries::
Queries that return a single object by identifier or unique property.
Describe the lookup mechanism and what happens when no match is found.

TIP: The following rules apply to all areas.

Do not change or add level 1 sections.

A `TIP` annotation provides additional information about behavior that deviates from the standard.
Do not change `TIP` annotations.

Use `NOTE` admonitions to mark prompts for improvement of the documentation.
Update existing `NOTE` admonitions if the prompt changes due to code changes.
