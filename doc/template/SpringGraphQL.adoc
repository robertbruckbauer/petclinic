= Name of the GraphQL API

Write a brief summary of the model and queries of this controller.
Take into account the names of types, fields, and query operations from the GraphQL schema definition.

== Schema

There is a separate section for each GraphQL type defined in the schema.
Use the include directive to reference the GraphQL schema files.
Let included schema definitions be a major part of the documentation.
Do not repeat information from the schema in the text.

Briefly describe the purpose of each type and its relationship to the domain model.
Reference the corresponding Java entity classes where applicable.

If the schema includes relationships that use batch loading (via @BatchMapping),
document the optimization strategy to avoid N+1 query problems.
Explain how related entities are efficiently loaded in a single database query.

If the schema uses a custom scalar type, document the type and its mapping to a Java type.
Do not mention standard scalar types.

== Queries

There is a separate section for each query operation.
The title consists of the query name.
Briefly describe the purpose of the query, its arguments and return value.

Create sections in the following order:

Collection queries::
Queries that return lists of objects.
Describe the purpose and any filtering arguments.

Object queries::
Queries that return a single object by identifier or unique property.
Describe the lookup mechanism and what happens when no match is found.
