<1> The field is marked with `@Version`.
<2> The field is marked with `@Column`.
The field name in the database is always specified as an important note for reviews and documentation.
<3> The field is marked with `@Getter`.
This allows the current value to be queried.
<4> The field is marked with `@JsonIgnore`.
The value is not included in the JSON structure of the REST API.
However, the value is transferred to an `ETAG` header.
<5> The field has the data type `Long`.
