= Column for type `String`

== Default Implementation

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@NotBlank <1>
@Column(name = "name") <2>
@Getter <3>
@JsonProperty <4>
private String name; <5>
----

<1> The field is marked with `@NotBlank` validation constraint.
This ensures the value is not null, not empty, and contains at least one non-whitespace character.
<2> The field is marked with `@Column`.
The column name in the database is explicitly specified.
<3> The field is marked with `@Getter`.
This allows the current value to be queried via a getter method.
<4> The field is marked with `@JsonProperty`.
The value is included in the JSON structure of the REST API.
<5> The field has the data type `String`.
This is a mutable field due to requirements from the JPA provider.

== Property initialization

`String` properties are typically not nullable and initialized to the empty string in the constructor.

== Property manipulation

`String` properties are typically not nullable and therfore only changed through REST API operations.

`String` properties are set through in the `withId()` operation during entity cloning.

== Property verification

`String` properties participate in the `isEqual` method comparison.
Use `Objects#equals`.

`String` properties use only the following validation annotations:

* `@NotNull`: Value must not be null
* `@NotBlank`: Value must be not null, not empty, and contain at least one non-whitespace character.

The `verify` operation may include custom validation logic (e.g., time ranges).

== Property serialization

`String` properties are by default part of the JSON structure.
