= Column for type `LocalDate`

== Default Implementation

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@NotNull <1>
@Column(name = "date", columnDefinition = "DATE") <2>
@Getter <3>
@JsonProperty <4>
@JsonFormat(shape = JsonFormat.Shape.STRING, pattern = DATE_PATTERN) <5>
private LocalDate date; <6>
----

<1> The field is marked with `@NotNull` validation constraint.
This ensures the value is not null.
<2> The field is marked with `@Column`.
The column name in the database is explicitly specified.
The column definition is explicitly specified as `DATE`.
<3> The field is marked with `@Getter`.
This allows the current value to be queried via a getter method.
<4> The field is marked with `@JsonProperty`.
The value is included in the JSON structure of the REST API.
<5> The field is marked with `@JsonFormat` to control JSON serialization format.
The pattern constant defines the date format.
<6> The field has type `LocalDate`.
This is a mutable field due to requirements from the JPA provider.

A `String` constant defines the date pattern for consistent formatting.
A `DateTimeFormatter` is created for parsing and formatting operations; use also in controller or unit tests for consistency.

== Property initialization

`LocalDate` properties are typically not nullable and initialized to a default date like `LocalDate.of(2000, 1, 1)` in the constructor.

== Property manipulation

`LocalDate` properties are typically not nullable and therefore only changed through REST API operations.

`LocalDate` properties are set through in the `withId()` operation during entity cloning.

Add a setter if a controller must be able to update a property directly.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@JsonIgnore <1>
public Enum setDate(@NonNull final LocalDate date) { <2>
    this.date = date;
    return this; <3>
}
----

<1> The method is marked with `@JsonIgnore` as it is not part of the JSON API.
<2> The method accepts a `LocalDate` argument.
<3> The method returns `this` for operation chaining.

== Property verification

`LocalDate` properties participate in the `isEqual` method comparison.
Use `Objects#equals`.

`LocalDate` properties use only the following validation annotations:

* `@NotNull`: Value must not be null
* `@Min(value)`: Value must be at least the specified minimum
* `@Max(value)`: Value must not exceed the specified maximum

The `verify` operation may include custom validation logic (e.g., date ranges).

== Property serialization

`LocalDate` properties are by default part of the JSON structure.
