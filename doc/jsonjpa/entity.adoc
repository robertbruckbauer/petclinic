= Entity definition

Entities fundamental classes of an application's domain model that define the properties and methods of objects used by the backend.
Within the class, fields are marked with specific annotations to define their storage, such as `@Column` for simple data or `@ElementCollection` for collections of data.
They are often linked to one another through relational annotations, including `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToMany`, and `@ManyToMany`.

Entities act as a bridge between the programming code and the database.
Each entity class typically corresponds to a database table defined in a `Liquibase` script.
