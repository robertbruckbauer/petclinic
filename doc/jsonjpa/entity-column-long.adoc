= Column for type `Long`

== Default Implementation

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PositiveOrZero <1>
@Column(name = "code") <2>
@Getter <3>
@JsonProperty <4>
private Long code; <5>
----

<1> The field is marked with `@PositiveOrZero` validation constraint.
This ensures the value is not negative (0 or greater).
<2> The field is marked with `@Column`.
The column name in the database is explicitly specified.
<3> The field is marked with `@Getter`.
This allows the current value to be queried via a getter method.
<4> The field is marked with `@JsonProperty`.
The value is included in the JSON structure of the REST API.
<5> The field has the data type `Long`.
This is a mutable field due to requirements from the JPA provider.

== Property initialization

`Long` properties are typically not nullable and initialized to `0L` in the constructor.

== Property manipulation

`Long` properties are typically not nullable and therefore only changed through REST API operations.

`Long` properties are set through in the `withId()` operation during entity cloning.

Add a setter if a controller must be able to update a property directly.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@JsonIgnore <1>
public Enum setCode(@NonNull final Long code) { <2>
    this.code = code;
    return this; <3>
}
----

<1> The method is marked with `@JsonIgnore` as it is not part of the JSON API.
<2> The method accepts a `Long` argument.
<3> The method returns `this` for operation chaining.

== Property verification

`Long` properties participate in the `isEqual` method comparison.
Use `Objects#equals`.

`Long` properties use only the following validation annotations:

* `@NotNull`: Value must not be null
* `@Positive`: Value must be greater than 0
* `@PositiveOrZero`: Value must be 0 or greater
* `@Min(value)`: Value must be at least the specified minimum
* `@Max(value)`: Value must not exceed the specified maximum

The `verify` operation may include custom validation logic (e.g., time ranges).

== Property serialization

`Long` properties are by default part of the JSON structure.
