= Column for a primary key

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@Id <1>
@Column(name = "id", nullable = false) <2>
@Getter <3>
@JsonProperty <4> 
private final UUID id; <5>
----

<1> The field is marked with `@Id`.
<2> The field is marked with `@Column`.
<3> The field is marked with `@Getter`.
This allows the current value to be queried.
<4> The field is marked with `@JsonProperty`.
The value is contained in the JSON structure of the REST API.
<5> The field has the data type `UUID`.
The value can also be null.

Generating a primary key with `UUID` has the advantage over generating a `Long` value from an `autoincrement` column or a database sequence in that the key can be generated not only in the database, but also on the server or even on the client if necessary.
