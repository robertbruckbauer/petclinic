= Pet GraphQL API

GraphQL API for querying pets in the pet clinic application.
It provides query operations to retrieve all pets or individual pets by identifier.

== Schema

=== Pet

The main GraphQL type representing a pet managed by this API.

.Schema Definition
[source,graphql,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{graphqldir}/pet.gqls[]
----

The `Pet` type corresponds to the entity class defined in the backend API:

.Entity
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{includedir}/lib/backend-api/src/main/java/esy/api/client/Pet.java[indent=0,tags=properties]
----

Each pet represents an animal owned by a client in the pet clinic.
The pet requires a valid name and species.
Each pet must have an owner.

NOTE: The documentation previously mentioned "birth date" as a required field, but the GraphQL schema does not include a `born` field. The Java entity `Pet` has a `born` property (LocalDate), but it is not exposed in the GraphQL schema defined in pet.gqls. If birth date should be queryable via GraphQL, add `born: LocalDate` to the Pet type in pet.gqls.

The `owner` field uses batch loading via `@BatchMapping` in the `OwnerGraphqlController` to efficiently load owner relationships and avoid N+1 query problems.
All owners for a batch of pets are loaded in a single database query.
