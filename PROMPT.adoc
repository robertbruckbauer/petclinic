== Sanity Check of REST API documentation

.Augment Code
----
Check all adoc files in @doc/restapi. Use @doc/template/SpringRestApi.adoc as template for the overall structure of an adoc file. Strictly follow rules from the template for the sanity check. Fix typos. Compare the description in the adoc files with the implementation in @lib/backend-api and @lib/backend-data. Find potential errors but only add prompts in the adoc file with hints for improving the description or instructions on how to fix the issue. Write instructions in such a way that they can be used as prompt for fixing the error. Use the `NOTE` admonition to mark each prompt. Take in account previously added `NOTE` admonitions regarding this error and update them. Only add `NOTE` admonitions if changes are recommended.
