=== Sanity Check of REST-API documentation

.Prompt
----
Check all adoc files in @doc/rest. Use @doc/template/SpringRestApi.adoc as template for the overall structure of an adoc file. Use notes from the template for the sanity check. Fix typos. Compare the description in the adoc files with the implementation in @lib/backend-api and @lib/backend-data. Find potential errors but only add prompts in the adoc file with hints and instructions on how to fix the issue. Use the `NOTE` admonition to mark each prompt.
----

The agent fixes minor issues like typos.
For all other issues, the agent adds a comment with hints and instructions to fix the issue.
Go through all adoc files and resolve the issues manually with the help of the hints and instructions or use the prompts to let _Augment Code_ fix the issue.
